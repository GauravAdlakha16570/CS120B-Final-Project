Summary of Project:
	The project is called Simon and is essentially a matching game. A series of 4 LEDs light up randomly and the user is meant to press corresponding buttons in the correct order after the light sequence is complete. Completing a sequence awards one point. The game starts with a sequence of four and as each sequence is beaten; the next is longer and more challenging, with the most challenging sequence being that of 9. Pressing an incorrect button displays a failure message and resets score to 0. Beating the game outputs a victory message and takes the game back to a start menu, ready to be played again.
